## Introduction

*Burger Meister* is a simple full-stack app created using Node.js, the Express web application framework, MySQL and a custom ORM. It functions as a simple demonstration of the MVC (Model / View / Controller) design pattern.

### Using Burger Meister
- To add a burger to the database, type the name of your burger in the input blank at the bottom of the screen and click the *Add Burger* button. The new burger will appear in a list on the left side of the screen.
- To "devour" a burger, click the *Devour It!* button directly to the right of it. The burger will shift to the right side of the screen.
